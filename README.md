# MCPBus

MCPBus allows exposing the existing APIs (like RESTful HTTP, native APIs, legacy systems and etc.) as a full-fledged MCP-server with support of prompts, resources and tools (all configured via config file with zero coding required).

The MCP version supported at the moment is `2025-03-26`.

More manuals will be released shortly, stay tuned.
